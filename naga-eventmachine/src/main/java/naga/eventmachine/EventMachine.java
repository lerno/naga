/**
 * EventMachine is a simple event service for driving asynchronous and delayed tasks
 * together with the a Naga NIOService.
 * <p>
 * Creating and starting an event machine:
 * <pre>
 * EventMachine em = new EventMachine();
 * // Start our event machine thread:
 * em.start();
 * </pre>
 * Delayed execution:
 * <pre>
 * em.executeLater(new Runnable() {
 *   public void run()
 *   {
 *      // Code here will execute after 1 second on the nio thread.
 *   }
 * }, 1000);
 * </pre>
 * Asynchronous execution, i.e. putting a task from another thread
 * to be executed on the EventMachine thread.
 * <pre>
 * em.asyncExecute(new Runnable() {
 *   public void run()
 *   {
 *      // Code here will be executed on the nio thread.
 *   }
 * });

 * It is possible to cancel scheduled tasks:
 * <pre>
 * // Schedule an event
 * DelayedEvent event = em.executeLater(new Runnable()
 *   public void run()
 *   {
 *      // Code to run in 1 minute.
 *   }
 * }, 60000);
 * // Cancel the event before it is executed.
 * event.cancel();
